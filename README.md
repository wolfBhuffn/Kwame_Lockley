# Portfolio - Kwame Lockley

## About me
Hi, I'm Kwame! 
I have been working in software testing for 2-3 years and have gained experience in various tools and technologies. My passion for technology and my eye for detail have led me to pursue a career in QA testing.

During my time in the industry, I have gained experience in a range of testing methodologies, including manual and automated testing. I have also worked with a variety of tools, such as Selenium, Jira, and Appium, to help ensure that the products I work on meet the highest standards of quality.

One of my strengths is my ability to think critically and identify potential issues in software before they become problems for users. I am a strong advocate for user-centric design and believe that testing is an integral part of the software development process.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and learning about the latest trends in software testing. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry developments.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
